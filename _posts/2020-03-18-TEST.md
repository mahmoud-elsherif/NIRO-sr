title: "Introducing: Non-Interventional, Reproducible, and Open (NIRO) Systematic Reviews"
summary: "Improving evidence synthesis outside interventional research"  
---

<p>
    Systematic reviews are complicated.
    Ensuring that they are reproducible and open is even more complex, and it's easy to overlook things or to adopt a workflow which makes reproducibility and transparency difficult to achieve.
    Whilst there are many (brilliant!) existing guidelines for conducting systematic reviews, many of these focus on a particular type of research centred around interventions.
    The NIRO Systematic Review checklist aims to provide a comprehensive set of guidelines for non-interventional research to help bring the gold-standard of evidence synthesis to other areas of research.
